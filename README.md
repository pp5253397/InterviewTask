# Python Developer Assignment - Submission

## Introduction
In this document, you'll find details of my completed tasks along with explanations of my approach and any assumptions made during the process.

## Task 1: Python Programming

### Completed Tasks
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loaded the provided dataset (`taskData.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame and performed necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated the average, median, and standard deviation of the 'price' column.
3. **Outlier Removal**: Identified and removed outliers from the dataset based on a threshold of 3 standard deviations from the mean.
4. **Exporting Cleaned Dataset**: Exported the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file named `cleaned_task_data.csv`.

### Approach
- Utilized Python and Pandas library to efficiently handle data loading, cleaning, and analysis.
- Implemented outlier removal based on statistical criteria to ensure data integrity.
- Exported the cleaned dataset to maintain a record of the processed data for further analysis.

## Task 2: RESTful API Development

### Completed Tasks
1. **API Development**: Developed a RESTful API using Flask.
2. **Endpoints**:
   - **GET /records**: Retrieves all records from the cleaned dataset.
   - **POST /filter**: Filters records based on a specific condition (e.g., price range) and returns the filtered results.
   - **POST /insert**: Inserts new records into the dataset.

### Approach
- Used Flask framework to create a lightweight and scalable RESTful API.
- Implemented endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the dataset.
- Ensured endpoints are well-documented and follow RESTful principles for ease of use and maintainability.

## Submission Details
- **Code Files**: Attached `Task1.py` and `main.py` containing the completed tasks.
- **Dependencies**: Both tasks were completed using Python 3.x with Pandas and Flask libraries.
- **Instructions**: Included instructions for running the code in the respective task directories.
- **Additional Notes**: Provided explanations of my approach, reasoning, and any limitations encountered during the tasks.

## Conclusion
Thank you once again for this opportunity. I thoroughly enjoyed working on these tasks and look forward to discussing my solutions further in the interview process. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best regards,
